# gradecalc

A kreta client written in flutter that calculates how much money I make from my grades. It is only for my personal use, it is not customizable (yet).
But if you want to, you can fork it and make it your own, but be ready to witness terrible code.

## It's a mess

Don't look at the code! You may get severe irreversible eye damage.
